#summary How to estimate the parameters of probabilistic rules

= Parameter estimation =

The probabilities and utilities specified in the effects of probabilistic rules can be automatically optimised from dialogue data. !OpenDial relies on [http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_196.html Bayesian learning] to perform this parameter estimation.  Each (univariate or multivariate) parameter is therefore associated with a specific distribution that is progressively narrowed down as more data points are observed in order to provide the best "fit" for the observed data.

== 1. Data collection ==

=== Recording dialogues ===

!OpenDial comes bundled with specific functions to export and import dialogues right from the user interface. To record a particular interaction, click on `Interactions -> Save Dialogue As...`.  The function will record the sequence of dialogue turns (from the user and from the system) in the form of an XML file.  Every turn contains a particular utterance (encoded as a probability distribution in the case of uncertain user inputs) as well as other optional contextual variables.  The recorded XML file follows the following skeleton:
{{{
<interaction>

  <userTurn>
    <variable id="u_u">
      <!-- distribution for the user utterance -->
    </variable>
    
    <!-- other contextual variables -->
  </userTurn>

  <systemTurn>
    <variable id="u_m">
      <!-- System utterance -->
    </variable>

    <!-- other contextual variables -->
  </systemTurn>

  <!-- etc. -->
}}}

The order of user and system turns is arbitrary (user turns can follow other user turns without any system utterance, and vice versa). The (domain-specific) contextual variables to include in each turn are specified in the [DialogueDomains#5._System_settings system settings].

!OpenDial can be paused/resumed at any time during the data collection using the `Interactions -> Pause/Resume` button.

=== Recording Wizard-of-Oz interactions ===

Another type of data which is useful to record is Wizard-of-Oz interactions. A Wizard-of-Oz experiment is an interaction in which a human user is asked to interact with a system that is remotely operated by a human agent.  A special `Wizard-of-Oz` mode is integrated in !OpenDial to facilitate the gathering of Wizard-of-Oz data. This mode is accessible by clicking on `Interactions -> Interaction Mode -> Wizard-of-Oz mode`.  

The Wizard-of-Oz mode delegates to the Wizard the responsibility of selecting the system actions.  When a new user input is received, !OpenDial will therefore trigger the domain models as usual, but will not select the highest-utility actions.  Instead, the system will show a list of possible actions on the right side of the chat window.  The wizard is then expected to select the most appropriate action in this list.

Note that the action selection box only displays actions that are relevant in the current situation (i.e. for which at least one utility rule specifies a utility). Using the domain from the [SimpleExample step-by-step example], three actions will therefore be available to the wizard after observing the user input `a_u=Request(Left)`, namely `Move(Left)`, `AskRepeat`, and the default `None` (representing the absence of any action).  

As for any dialogue, Wizard-of-Oz interactions can be saved to a file by clicking on `Interactions -> Save Dialogue As`.

== Importing dialogues ==

Previously recorded dialogues can be imported via `Interactions -> Import Dialogue From...`.  This function does more than simply displaying the dialogue history in the chat window - it actually "replays" the full interaction, performing dialogue update at each step (including the update of parameter distributions). This import function is therefore a crucial tool to estimate model parameters based on previously recorded dialogue data. 

= 2. Supervised learning of parameters ==

=== Learning from raw dialogues ===

Some parameters can be directly learned from raw, unannotated dialogues.  Take for instance the dialogue domain described in the [SimpleExample step-by-step example].  The parameter `theta_repeatpredict` (which reflects the probability that the user will comply to the system request to repeat the instruction) can be automatically estimated through repeated interactions with users. Each observed dialogue act `a_u` after a system request `AskRepeat` will thus trigger a Bayesian update of the parameter.

One can easily test this learning mechanism by starting !OpenDial with the domain `domains/examples/example-step-by-step.xml` and entering a few instructions with a low probability (in order to trigger the `AskRepeat` response).  The state viewer shows how the prior prediction `a_u^p` and the actual dialogue act `a_u'` are combined.

The parameter `theta_repeatpredict` is automatically refined as a result of this update.

Once the interaction is complete, the posterior parameter distributions can be exported by clicking on `Domains -> Export -> Parameters`. As the posterior distribution of `theta_repeatpredict` may not be a Dirichlet distribution anymore due to the partial observability of the graphical model, the posterior distribution is encoded as a multivariate Gaussian distribution (with a diagonal covariance).

=== Learning from Wizard-of-Oz data ===

Although the probability parameter `theta_repeatpredict` on the predicted user act could be directly estimated from raw dialogues, this 
is not the case for the utility `theta_repeat`.  Indeed, there is no way the system could learn the utility of the `AskRepeat` action without receiving some feedback on the desirability of this action.

One simple way to estimate such utility parameters is to collect Wizard-of-Oz data.

and replayed at a later time to re-run the parameter estimation.
