#summary Encoding rule-structured dialogue domains in XML.

= Dialogue domains =

This section details how to practically encode dialogue domains for !OpenDial using XML.

== General structure ==

A !OpenDial dialogue domain follows the skeleton below:
{{{
<domain>

  <initialstate>
    <!--(optional) initial state variables -->
  </initialstate>

  <parameters>
    <!--(optional) prior distributions for rule parameters -->
  </parameters>

  <model trigger="trigger variables for model 1">
    <!--probabilistic rules for model 1 -->
  </model>

  <model trigger="trigger variables for model 2">
    <!-- probabilistic rules for model 2 -->
  </model>

  ... 

  <model trigger="trigger variables for model n">
    <!-- probabilistic rules for model n -->
  </model>


  <settings>
    <!--(optional) domain-specific settings -->
  </settings>

</domain>

}}}

The settings, initial state and parameters can be left out of the domain specification if empty.  The number of rule-structured models is arbitrary.

For more complex domains, splitting the domain specification in several times can be useful.   The `import` marker can be used to import the content of another XML file:
{{{
    <import href="path to another file" />
}}}

Examples of domain specification can be found in the directory `domains` and `test/domains` of the base directory.

== Initial state and parameters ==

== Models ==

A dialogue model is essentially defined as a set of probabilistic rules combined with one or more "trigger variables" that defines when the rules are to be applied:
{{{
<model trigger="trigger variable(s)">

 <rule id="rule 1">
      ...
 </rule>

 <rule id="rule 2">
      ...
 </rule>

 ...

 <rule id="rule n">
      ...
 </rule>

</model>
}}}

The rules can either encode probability or utility rules, as explained below (also see [http://folk.uio.no/plison/pdfs/thesis/thesis-plison2013.pdf Pierre Lison's Ph.D. thesis] for more explanations).
