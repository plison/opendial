We suggest you to download the release packages of the toolkit, as the bleeding-edge code on the SVN may contain unstable elements that have not yet been thoroughly tested.

 * [http://opendial.googlecode.com/svn/downloads/ older versions]

=== Bleeding-edge version:===

If you prefer to work with the code on the SVN development trunk, simply enter the following to checkout the code:
{{{
 svn checkout http://opendial.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ opendial
}}}


See the [OpenDialUserManual user manual] for more instructions on how to use !OpenDial.
