 * *What is the relationship between !OpenDial and MDP/POMDP approaches?*

As in existing statistical frameworks, !OpenDial represents the dialogue state as a Bayesian network that is regularly updated with new observations and employed to derive the system's actions.  The key difference between !OpenDial and traditional MDP/POMDP approaches is that the domain models (i.e. the transition, reward and observation models) are expressed via _probabilistic rules_. 

The rules are essentially high-level templates for probabilistic graphical models.  They provide an abstraction layer that allows the system designer to capture the domain in a concise and human-readable form, with a limited number of parameters.  In other words, !OpenDial can be seen as a "structured POMDP" approach. See [http://folk.uio.no/plison/pdfs/thesis/thesis-plison2014.pdf Lison (2014)] for a full description of the approach.

 * *I get the following message when I try to compile !OpenDial with `ant`: `javac: invalid target release: 1.8`*.

All version of !OpenDial > 0.95 require Java 8 in order to compile.  Simply download and install the Java 8 JDK in order to resolve the issue.
