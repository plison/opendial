#summary Quick start guide to OpenDial

= Getting started =


== Downloading !OpenDial ==

The first step is of course to download the !OpenDial software.  You can either download a release package or directly checkout the latest, bleeding edge version of the toolkit on the SVN repository.

 * *Release packages*: _TODO_

 * *SVN repository*: Enter the following to checkout the latest !OpenDial version from the SVN:
{{{
 svn checkout http://opendial.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ opendial
}}}

NB: this checkout is read-only. If you want to commit your own changes (either to the trunk or to a separate branch), feel free to contact me, I will simply add you as a project contributor.

== Compiling !OpenDial ==

If you have downloaded !OpenDial from the SVN, you'll need to compile the Java source code.  The easiest way to do it is via [http://ant.apache.org Ant]. First check whether ant is installed on your machine (simply type `ant` on the command line and see the result).

To compile the !OpenDial source codes, simply go to the main opendial directory (containing the `build.xml`file) and type:
{{{
ant
}}}

The above command will compile all java files and install the classes in the `bin` directory.

You can check whether !OpenDial works as expected by running the JUnit tests:
{{{
ant test
}}}
If everything works correctly, all tests should be successful (although it is not unusual to encounter one or two failed tests because of approximation errors during sampling).


== Starting !OpenDial ==

Once !OpenDial is installed and compiled, you are now ready to run it.  Simply type:
{{{
ant run
}}}

A window similar to this one should pop up:

Additional properties can be included in the command line.  All these properties are optional (and can usually also be changed through the graphical interface):
|| *Property* || *Value* ||
|| domain || File path for domain specification (cf. [DialogueDomains Specifying Dialogue Domains]) ||
|| settings || File path for system settings (default is in `resources/settings.xml`) ||
|| dialogue || File path of previously recorded dialogue to import ||
|| simulator || Filepath of domain specification for a user simulator (cf. [ParameterEstimation Learning parameters from data]) ||
|| gui || `true`/`false` to activate or deactivate the graphical interface (default is `true`). ||

Command line parameters must be specified in the following manner:
{{{
ant run -Dproperty=value -Dproperty2=value2 ....
}}}
