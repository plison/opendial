= External modules ==

Although probabilistic rules can represent a wide range of domain-specific knowledge and reasoning patterns, external modules remain of course necessary to interface the system with its environment -- for instance to perform tasks such as speech recognition, contextual awareness, and speech synthesis. This section explains how to implement such modules.


All !OpenDial modules are required to implement the interface `Module` shown below:
{{{

  /**
   * Starts the module. 
   * 
   * @throws DialException if the initialisation fails
   */
  public void start() throws DialException;

  /**
   * Triggers the module after a state update
   * 
   * @param state the dialogue state
   * @param updatedVars the set of updated variables
   */
  public void trigger(DialogueState state, Collection<String> updatedVars);

  /**
   * Pauses the current module
   * 
   * @param toPause whether to pause or resume the module
   */
  public void pause(boolean toPause);

  
  /**
   * Returns true if the module is running (i.e. started and not paused), and
   * false otherwise
   * 
   * @return whether the module is running or not
   */
  public boolean isRunning();
}}}


The `start` method corresponds to the initialisation of the module. The `pause` method is employed to temporarily interrupt the execution of the module.  The `isRunning` method returns the current execution status of the module.  Finally, the `trigger` method activates the module execution following a particular state update.

== Synchronous modules ==

Some modules operate in synchronous mode. Synchronous modules are triggered upon each update of the dialogue state.

The core of a synchronous module is its implementation of the method `trigger(...)`. Given the current dialogue state and a list of recently updated variables, the method is expected to trigger the module's internal processing, and possibly re-update the dialogue state via the method `addContent(...)` in `DialogueSystem`.

An basic example of synchronous module is shown in [http://opendial.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/opendial/modules/examples/ModuleExample1.java src/opendial/modules/examples/ModuleExample1.java].  The module creates a small grid window with the location of the agent at its center.  When applied together with the [SimpleExample step-by-step example], the grid window is updated after each movement to reflect the new position.

== Asynchronous modules ==

Other modules run independently of the dialogue state. Such asynchronous modules typically relate to visual or speech perception tasks. Asynchronous modules update the dialogue state as soon as new observations are made available.

Asynchronous modules must run in a separate thread to avoid blocking the execution of other system components.

An basic example of asynchronous module is shown in [http://opendial.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/opendial/modules/examples/ModuleExample2.java src/opendial/modules/examples/ModuleExample2.java]. This example is also intended to work in conjunction with the [SimpleExample step-by-step example]. The module creates a small grid window with four arrow buttons that can be clicked to instruct the agent to move in a particular direction. The method `system.addContent(...)` is employed to update the dialogue state with new information.  The domain models and modules are then triggered after this operation. 

Note that the `trigger` method is empty in this example, as the module runs independently of any state update.


== Attaching a module ==

Once it is implemented, a module can be attached to the dialogue system.  This can be done in several ways:

 * You can specify the module's full classname (e.g. `opendial.modules.ModuleExample1`) in the `<modules>` property of the [DialogueDomains#5._Settings domain settings]. 

 * you can also directly include the module classname to the command line properties, with the flag `-Dmodules=classname` (notice the `-D` prefix). If the module requires additional parameters, you can add them as additional command line properties, e.g. `-DparamName=paramValue`.

 * Finally, you can also attach the module programmatically by creating the module instance and then calling the method `attachModule(...)` in the current `DialogueSystem`.


The two first options will only work for modules that have a constructor that specifies the `DialogueSystem` instance as only argument (such as is the case for `ModuleExample1` and `ModuleExample2`). The third option will work for module with arbitrary constructors.

Modules can require some specific settings to be specified before initialisation. Such settings can be directly encoded as new properties in the `<settings>` element of the dialogue domain specification.
