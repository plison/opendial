abstract = {During the last decade, research in the field of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) has experienced increasing growth. However, the design and optimization of SDS is not only about combining speech and language processing systems such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), parsers, Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis systems. It also requires the development of dialogue strategies taking at least into account the performances of these subsystems (and others), the nature of the task (e.g. form filling, tutoring, robot control, or database search/browsing), and the user?s behaviour (e.g. cooperativeness, expertise). Due to the great variability of these factors, reuse of previous hand-crafted designs is also made very difficult. For these reasons, statistical machine learning (ML) methods applied to automatic SDS optimization have been a leading research area for the last few years. In this paper, we provide a short review of the field and of recent advances. }

  title = {Towards Relational {POMDPs} for adaptive dialogue management},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and 
high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem.  
Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity 
of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues in tandem.  This paper describes ongoing work on 
a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap.  We represent the interaction as a Partially 
Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and 
environment models.  The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically 
constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures.  These constraints 
are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network.  The first-order expressivity of 
Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over 
large regions of the state and action spaces.},

  abstract = {An important difficulty in developing spoken dialogue systems for robots is 
the open-ended nature of most interactions. Robotic agents must typically operate in 
complex, continuously changing environments which are difficult to model and do not 
provide any clear, predefined goal. Directly capturing this complexity in a single, large 
dialogue policy is thus inadequate. This paper presents a new approach which tackles 
the complexity of open-ended interactions by breaking it into a set of small, independent 
policies, which can be activated and deactivated at runtime by a dedicated mechanism. 
The approach is currently being implemented in a spoken dialogue system for autonomous 
robots.},

  abstract = {To interact naturally with humans, robots needs to be aware of their own surroundings. This awareness 
is usually encoded in some implicit or explicit representation of the situated context.  In this paper, we present 
a new framework for constructing rich belief models of the robot's environment.  Key to our approach is the use 
of \textit{Markov Logic} as a unified representation formalism.  Markov Logic is a combination of first-order logic 
and probabilistic graphical models.  Its expressive power allows us to capture both the rich relational structure of 
the environment and the uncertainty arising from the noise and incompleteness of low-level sensory data.  The 
constructed belief models evolve dynamically over time and incorporate various contextual information such as 
spatio-temporal framing, multi-agent epistemic status, and saliency measures.  Beliefs can also be referenced and 
extended ``top-down'' via linguistic communication.  The approach is being integrated into a cognitive architecture
 for mobile robots interacting with humans using spoken dialogue.},

  abstract = {Spoken dialogue is notoriously hard to process with standard language
processing technologies. Dialogue systems must indeed meet two major chal-
lenges. First, natural spoken dialogue is replete with disfluent, partial, elided or
ungrammatical utterances. Second, speech recognition remains a highly error-
prone task, especially for complex, open-ended domains. We present an inte-
grated approach for addressing these two issues, based on a robust incremental
parser. The parser takes word lattices as input and is able to handle ill-formed
and misrecognised utterances by selectively relaxing its set of grammatical rules.
The choice of the most relevant interpretation is then realised via a discrimina-
tive model augmented with contextual information. The approach is fully im-
plemented in a dialogue system for autonomous robots. Evaluation results on a
Wizard of Oz test suite demonstrate very significant improvements in accuracy
and robustness compared to the baseline.},

It has recently gained widespread interest in the computational linguistics community and has been used for applications such as information extraction, machine translation and question answering. In this article, we review the current state of the art in dependency parsing, starting with a characterization of the basic problem and some motivation for why dependency parsing may be a useful alternative to other forms of syntactic parsing. The major part of the article is devoted to an examination of the four main approaches that exist in the field today: context-free dependency parsing, constraint dependency parsing, graph-based dependency parsing, and transition-based dependency parsing. Each approach is described in detail and its strengths and weaknesses are highlighted.}},

    abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes ({POMDPs}) provide a rich framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty in stochastic domains. However, solving a {POMDP} is often intractable except for small problems due to their complexity. Here, we focus on online approaches that alleviate the computational complexity by computing good local policies at each decision step during the execution. Online algorithms gener- ally consist of a lookahead search to ?nd the best action to execute at each time step in an environment. Our ob jectives here are to survey the various existing online {POMDP} methods, analyze their properties and discuss their advantages and disadvantages; and to thoroughly evaluate these online approaches in di?erent environments under various metrics (return, error bound reduction, lower bound improvement). Our experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art online heuristic search methods can handle large {POMDP} domains e?ciently.},

By analyzing the user's utterance while it is still in progress, systems can provide more human-like overlapping and backchannel responses to convey their level of understanding and respond more quickly. In this paper, we look at examples of several overlapping response types in human-human dialogues, and present an initial computational model of the incremental grounding process in these responses. Additionally, we describe an implementation of this model in a virtual human dialogue system that can provide backchannels, head nods, frowns, completions and low latency responses.},
