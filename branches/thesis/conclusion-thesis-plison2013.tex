\label{chap:conclusions}

\section{Summary of contributions}

\subsubsection*{A new, hybrid approach to dialogue management}

\note{be able to capture richer conversational context, and better account for the cooperative nature of dialogue (e.g. Jokinen's argument).}

\subsubsection*{Estimation of rule parameters from Wizard-of-Oz data}

\subsubsection*{Estimation of rule parameters via Bayesian reinforcement learning}

\subsubsection*{Development of the \opendial toolkit}

\section{Future work}

\note{Formally characterise the expressivity of the rules and extend them to handle Ginzburg style update rules?}

\subsubsection*{Reinforcement learning with live interactions}

\note{Try to learn a policy in a fully online fashion with real users, without simulator}

\subsubsection*{Combination of imitation and reinforcement learning}

\note{do online reinforcement learning with real users and combine imitation+reinforcement learning. cognitive basis for this (toddlers).  in line with Henderson's approach and others (Verena, Jason)}

\subsubsection*{Joint optimisation of dialogue models}

\note{joint optimisation of models}

\subsubsection*{Incrementality and turn-taking}

\subsubsection*{Scaling up to more complex domains}

\note{more complex domains, with more variables and more complex dynamics}
