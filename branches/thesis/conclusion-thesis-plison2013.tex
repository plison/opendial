\label{chap:conclusions}

\section{Summary of contributions}

\note{be able to capture richer conversational context, and better account for the cooperative nature of dialogue (e.g. Jokinen's argument against classical utility maximisation approaches).}

\section{Future work}

\note{Formally characterise the expressivity of the rules and extend them to handle Ginzburg style update rules?}

\note{more complex domains, with more variables and more complex dynamics}

\note{Try to learn a policy in a fully online fashion with real users, without simulator}

\note{do online reinforcement learning with real users and combine imitation+reinforcement learning}

\note{joint optimisation of models}
