\item [Typesetting: ] The thesis is written with \LaTeXe \ based on a document layout prepared by the University of Oslo. The bibliographical references are generated with \textsc{Bib}\negthinspace\TeX. The diagrams and data plots are drawn using Apple's \textit{Pages} and \textit{Numbers} applications, while the mathematical figures are rendered with the \textit{MATLAB} numerical computing environment.
