\note{derivation of the MLE estimate for a categorical distribution by deriving the likelihood function.  Use Lagrange?}

\note{show that the posterior distribution after seeing an example is not a dirichlet anymore, but is still in the exponential family.  --> really useful?we are only dealing with partially observed data anyway}
