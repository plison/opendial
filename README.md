## OpenDial

**OpenDial** is a Java-based, domain-independent toolkit for developing
 spoken dialogue systems. The primary focus of OpenDial is on robust
 and adaptive dialogue management, but OpenDial can also be used to
 build full-fledged, end-to-end dialogue systems, integrating speech
 recognition, language understanding, generation and speech synthesis.

The purpose of OpenDial is to combine the benefits of logical and
statistical approaches to dialogue modelling into a single framework.
The toolkit relies on *probabilistic rules* to represent the domain
models in a compact and human-readable format. Supervised or
reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to automatically
estimate unknown rule parameters from relatively small amounts of
data (see [Lison (2014)](http://folk.uio.no/plison/pdfs/thesis/thesis-plison2014.pdf) for details).
The hybrid approach adopted by OpenDial makes it possible to incorporate
expert knowledge and domain-specific constraints in a robust, probabilistic framework.

OpenDial is designed as a blackboard architecture in which all system
modules are connected to a central information hub representing the
dialogue state (which is encoded as a Bayesian Network). Modules can
therefore be plugged in and out of the system without affecting the rest
of the processing pipeline. A collection of plugins is available to
connect external components (for speech recognition, parsing, speech
synthesis, etc.). New modules can also be easily implemented and integrated
into the OpenDial architecture.

The toolkit has been originally developed by the [Language Technology Group](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/ltg/) of the University of Oslo (Norway), with [Pierre Lison](http://nr.no/~plison) as main developer.
